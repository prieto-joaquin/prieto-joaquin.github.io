Hi! I am a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/People/Joaquin-Prieto" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute (III)</a>  at the LSE and responsible for the Diploma in <a href="https://gobierno.uchile.cl/postgrado/educacion-continua/cursos-ejecutivos" target="_blank">Advanced Methods in Statistics and Data Science</a> of the Faculty of Government of the University of Chile.

My current work focuses on three lines of research aimed at expanding and developing new economic and social well-being measures to design better policies that could lead emerging countries towards more inclusive and sustainable development. These research lines are i) forward-looking well-being measures, such as vulnerability to poverty and economic insecurity; ii) spatial measures of inequality, such as the geography of opportunity; iii) labour market development measures, such as quality of employment.

I am a member of the <a href="http://waplac.org/country-members" target="_blank">  WAPLAC Network</a> (Welfare and Policy in Latin America and the the Caribbean), of <a href="https://quality-employment.org" target="_blank"> Quality of Employment group</a> of the III at LSE, of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/weipo-uah/team" target="_blank"> WEIPO</a> (Wellbeing, Inequality, Poverty and Public Policy group in the Department of Economics at the University of Alcalá de Henares, Spain) and the <a href="https://hd-ca.org/thematic_group/work-employment)" target="_blank"> Work and Employment Thematic Group</a> of the Human Development & Capability Association.

I obtained a PhD in Social Policy at LSE. In addition, I hold a BA in Industrial Engineering, an MSc in Economy and Environmental Management and post-graduate studies in Sociology from Universidad Católica in Chile. Before joining LSE International Inequalities Institute, I founded and directed the Social Observatory at Universidad Alberto Hurtado in Chile (specialized in longitudinal data for social policy design, implementation and monitoring). Complementarily, I have worked as a consultant for the OECD, I-ADB, ILO, and Rand Corporation and as a research fellow at Lincoln Institute Land Policy.

_Research interests:_  Poverty dynamics and income mobility; Longitudinal survey methodology and survey quality; Well-being and welfare states development; Geography of opportunity and spatial analysis; Inequality and labour markets; Applied micro-econometrics and social policies.
