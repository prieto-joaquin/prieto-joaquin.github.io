Hi! I am a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/People/Joaquin-Prieto" target="_blank"> International Inequalities Institute (III)</a> at the LSE, and I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://gobierno.uchile.cl/noticias/224174/facultad-de-gobierno-recibe-a-nuevos-investigadores-postdoctorales-" target="_blank"> Faculty of Government at the University of Chile</a>, where I am also responsible for the Diploma in <a href="https://gobierno.uchile.cl/postgrado/educacion-continua/cursos-ejecutivos" target="_blank">Advanced Methods in Statistics and Data Science</a>.

My current work focuses on four lines of research aimed at expanding and developing new economic and social well-being measures to help design better policies that guide emerging countries towards more inclusive and sustainable development. These research lines are:
i) forward-looking well-being measures, such as vulnerability to poverty and economic insecurity;
ii) the comparative study of welfare state regimes and regional development;
iii) the dynamics between the public and private sectors in shaping labour markets; and
iv) the use of data science to inform government and public policy, with a strong focus on evidence-based policy evaluation.

I obtained a PhD in Social Policy at LSE. In addition, I hold a BA in Industrial Engineering, an MSc in Economy and Environmental Management and postgraduate studies in Sociology from Universidad Católica in Chile. Before joining LSE International Inequalities Institute, I founded and directed the Social Observatory at Universidad Alberto Hurtado in Chile (specialized in longitudinal data for social policy design, implementation and monitoring). Complementarily, I have worked as a consultant for the OECD, I-ADB, ILO, ECLAC, and Rand Corporation and as a research fellow at Lincoln Institute Land Policy.

I am a member of the <a href="http://waplac.org/country-members" target="_blank">  WAPLAC Network</a> (Welfare and Policy in Latin America and the Caribbean), of <a href="https://quality-employment.org" target="_blank"> Quality of Employment group</a> of the III at LSE, of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/weipo-uah/team" target="_blank"> WEIPO</a> (Wellbeing, Inequality, Poverty and Public Policy group in the Department of Economics at the University of Alcalá de Henares, Spain) and the <a href="https://hd-ca.org/thematic_group/work-employment)" target="_blank"> Work and Employment Thematic Group</a> of the Human Development & Capability Association.

_Research interests:_  Emerging welfare architectures; data-driven policy innovation; dynamic and multidimensional approaches to poverty and inequality in global development contexts; economic security in a changing world of work; regional inequalities and spatial disparities; cross-national approaches to social protection; collaborative public-private governance in evolving labour markets; public sector innovation.
